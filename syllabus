COURSE DESCRIPTION 
This class will be focusing on the technical skill of digital video editing as well as the aesthetic qualities and content, all at the same time. You will be exploring your relationship to our own individual voice as an artist. This means becoming aware of the editing styles and tropes of time based media in the world around you, such as television and popular movies, and consciously choosing which to use and which to avoid. You will learn to step out of the common pattern of editing and develop your own rhythm. During critiques and discussions you will be asked to think about popular culture and how it affects your making, as well as your viewing.


LEARNING OBJECTIVES
– Become competent in the technical elements of non-linear composite editing.
– Gain the ability to demonstrate familiarity with the work and ideas of video.
– Ability to articulate and critique on time based media work.

COURSE MATERIALS
– Reading handouts from instructor
– External hard drive/USB drive
– Patience

COURSE PROJECTS AND ASSIGNMENTS 
All class projects and assignments are to be turned in before or on the date due, specified in the syllabus.  These projects and assignments will require you to work outside of the scheduled class time in the lab to complete them.  Please plan ahead and schedule your week accordingly.  If class is missed, it is your responsibility to make up for the work missed in the class.  If a project is turned in late it will affect its grade.   

READINGS
Reading handouts will be given via the website listed above. All readings must be printed to be read, underlined, notated and brought to class to help you participate in discussions. These noted print outs will be turned in as homework. Don’t understand something? Highlight it. Disagree with something? Write it down in the margins. Want me to explain something? Underline it. 





GRADING
• Students must complete all assignments in a professional manner and on time.
• Students must participate in class discussions and critiques.

ATTENDANCE POLICY
*Arriving to class later than 15 minutes counts as 1 absence.

*Attendance and punctuality are required at all classes. If you arrive late to class,
 you will be marked absent. Final grade will drop one full letter grade if student
 has missed more than two classes.  Absence in more than three classes will 
 constitute grounds for assigning a grade of ‘F’’.  

EXPECTATIONS of STUDENTS
It is expected that additional time, on a weekly basis, will be spent on your assignments and projects. It is your responsibility to plan ahead and schedule sufficient time outside of class each week for homework and individual lab time. It is also expected that students read, review, and practice material pertinent to the class schedule, for each class, before coming to class. Students will learn from each other as well as the instructor.  Understanding that there might be technical expertise differences, more experienced students could be called upon to help beginning students with course material.

Not homework, but good to watch. It’s like yummy tasting vegetables. 
Maybe watch it while we await these election results.
Why is creativity so important during times like these? Well, watch and tell me what you think:
